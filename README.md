BA = Breakaway

SP = Southpaw

A 4x12 + 4x4 ortho keyboard with USB C, SMD components, and 19mm spacing.

This is essentially a dumbed down Planck clone plus a southpaw numpad. The numpad is able to be snapped off to have just a 4x12.

**I AM CONSTANTLY TWEAKING THE DESIGN. I HAVE NOT ORDERED A PHYSICAL PCB YET.**

Although everything should<sup>(tm)</sup> work as is, it hasn't been physically tested, and I like playing with the traces to make it prettier/more efficient.

**USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!!!** I am not responsible for any dumb things you do, fry your computer, break anything, etc.

#### Why is it named therick?
It started in fall of 2005 when I was just a boy. I started a new job, and needed a login name. The manager wrote The Rick (my first name is Rick). It has stuck ever since. Thanks, Sam!
