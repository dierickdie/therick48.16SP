SP = Southpaw

A 4x12 + 4x4 (48.16) ortho keyboard with USB C, SMD components, and 19mm spacing.

This is essentially a dumbed down Planck clone plus a southpaw numpad. The numpad is able to be snapped off to have just a 4x12.

If you want a regular side numpad, look at the [therick48.16](https://github.com/therickthe/therick64BA). It uses the same firmware.

**Note: firmware is the same as therick48.16**

Although everything should<sup>(tm)</sup> work as is, it hasn't been physically tested.

#### Why is it named therick?
It started in fall of 2005 when I was just a boy. I started a new job, and needed a login name. The manager wrote The Rick (my first name is Rick). It has stuck ever since. Thanks, Sam! 64 is for 64 keys. Hope that was obvious.
